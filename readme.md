### A dynamically typed interpreted scripting language.

###### the name came from the language originally being created to edit images progamatically

## About
Quilt is a hobby project of mine. I designed it to be a simple, with a syntax similar to rust and python. I needed a language that I could use within my own projects that could be easily embedded and extended. I also wanted to learn more about how to build a programming language. 

[crafting interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/a-bytecode-virtual-machine.html) was a great resource during the development of the backend.

## Features
- Dynamically typed
- Bytecode interpreter
- First class functions
- Closures
- Extendable native rust builtins
- Relatively fast (about `1.5x` - `2.5x` slower than python to calculate `fib(30)` & `fib(40)`)
- Python style dissasembler
<!-- - No garbage collection (yet..., for now all data is immutable, so it can be reference counted) -->

## Roadmap
- Spread operator
- Short circuiting
- `break` and `continue` statements
- `return` statements
- user created errors and error handling
- repl

## Examples
```rust
// includes 
include "std/math.ql"

// recursion
fn fib(n) {
    if n < 2 {
        return n
    } 
    
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
}

fib(30)


// loops
let i = 0
// assignements are expressions (as well as if statements and loops)
let res = while (i = i + 1) < 10 {
    i * 20
}

// native rust function
@print(res)

// for loops
for i in 0:10 {
    for j in [1, 2, 3, i] {
        @print(i, j)
    }
    @print(i)
}

// destructuring
let a, b = (1, 2)
for a, b, c in [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]] {
    @print(a, b, c)
}

// closures
fn NewCounter() {
    let count = 0

    fn Increment() {
        count = count + 1
    }

    fn Decrement() {
        count = count - 1
    }

    // lambdas
    let Get = fn() { count }

    // implicit return
    [Increment, Decrement, Get]
}

let incr, decr, get = NewCounter()
```

## Disassembler Output
```rust
fn fib(n) {
    if n < 2 {
        n
    } else {
        fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
    }
}

fib(30)
```
